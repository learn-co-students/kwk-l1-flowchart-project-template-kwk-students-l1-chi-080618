    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>At One Humanity, we believe in the importance of empowering the individual to make their own change in the world. Often times, many people find themselves inspired to contribute to humanitarian causes but they may not know how to or which to choose from. Our goal is to take your passion for helping others and focus that energy into a specific cause that needs more attention. Simply take our short quiz to determine what charitable organization you should donate to or volunteer for. We also have a gallery of different organizations if you're looking for even more information. Head to the quiz portion of the site & find out how you will make your impact now! </p>
