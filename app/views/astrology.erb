  <h3 class="para"> You may be familar with "zodiac signs". But, did you know that there are many ways to define a zodiac sign. The one you are most associated with is your "Sun sign". Your sun sign is your "zodiac personality".  There are actually two more "zodiac" signs that identify you. </h3> 
 <h3 class="para"> One of the signs that help identify you is a rising sign. Your rising sign helps identify the outer you. The thing about your rising sign is that it changes depending on the time of day. So you may be a Taurus one hour, and then be an Aries the next. Another thing that helps identify you is called your moon sign.Your moon sign identifies your inner mood/emotions. Your moon sign is a calculation of the full date, place, and time of your birth. Your sun and your moon sign describe the entire emotional mode of operation. </h3>

  <li>Ursa Major, the great bear, is best known as the big dipper and two if the stars in the constilation form a line that will always point to Polaris, the north star.</li>
  <li>Pegasus, the flying horse, is from a greek myth.  He was born from the sea foam after the monster Medusa was killed.  One of the brightest stars in the constilation is II Pegasi and if the Earth was orbiting it, the solar flares that II Pegsai gives off could destry the ozone layer and the atmosphere, causing destruction for all those on Earth. </li></p>
