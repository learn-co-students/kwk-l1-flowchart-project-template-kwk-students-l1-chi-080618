    <h3>Our Mission</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Eat.safe Chicago set out to solve a simple problem â€“ how can food-allergic and food-intolerant diners quickly and easily find restaurants that will properly accommodate their individual dietary needs? Our goal is to give people with food allergies opportunities to enjoy a delicious meal out without having to worry about having an allergic reaction and feeling restricted to certain options.</p>
